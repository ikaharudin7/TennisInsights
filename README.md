This project contains data analysis and Machine-Learning techniques on professional tennis (ATP Tour) data from 1968 to present. Data is taken from this GitHub Repository: https://github.com/JeffSackmann/tennis_atp/tree/master

Please take a look at the more interesting insights which I have gathered in this project - from someone with a heavy interest in tennis!

While no apparent trend is observed with the 1st Serve differential, the 2nd serve differential is largest on clay, the slowest surface. 
Likely due to the fact that 2nd serves with topspin will bounce high, making the returner more likely to struggle, as opposed to grass, where the ball won't bounce nearly as much. 
Heightens the importance of a strong 2nd serve to win matches on clay. 

The above graphic was analysed in Python, with Shiny.
