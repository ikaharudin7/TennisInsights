# Average Age of ATP Tour Level Winners since 2010. 

This Shiny app visualizes the average age of tennis match winners at ATP level since 2010. 

## Notes
Every year in November/December, there is a consistent drop in the average age of match winners.
This is due to the Under 21 ATP NEXTGEN Finals tournament that occurs during that time.
2015-2017 was the peak of the Big 4 Era, with veterans hitting near 30 during those years.
Average age has declined since, due to the emergence of NEXTGEN players Alcaraz, Sinner, Ruud, Medvedev, Tsitsipas

### Data Source
